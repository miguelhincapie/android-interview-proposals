/**
 * The main task in this exercise is just add another payment type CASH and be able to
 * pay using the four payment types.
 * <p>
 * The problem:
 * A naive solution would be just add the CASH type to the enum, create a private fun to pay using cash
 * and last, add the new case inside the "when" in pay function.
 * <p>
 * What we are look for here is to know if the candidate knows about Open-closed principle.
